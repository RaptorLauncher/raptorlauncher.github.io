<h2>Version 0.3 is out!</h2>
<h1>ACTUALLY FIXED NOW</h1>
<h1>ACTUALLY NOT YET NOW, ISSUES HAPPENED</h1>
<p>Raptor Launcher 0.3 is built and available at <a href="http://www52.zippyshare.com/v/kZShiWIv/file.html">HERE</a></p>

<p>Changelog:</p>
<ul>
<li>Per-character images work now! (150x400 is the recommended size)</li>
<li>Multiselect works properly on the alt list, feel free to launch 20 alts at once if you feel like it.â„¢</li>
<li>New in config: by default, the launcher only synchronizes in the beginning in order to save time. Remember to always synchronize after you change your description in FurEd, otherwise your changes will be *lost*. If you often change your descriptions, select the option to always synchronize, which will take a while but keep your characters safe.</li>
<li>Minor fixes everywhere.</li>
</ul>
